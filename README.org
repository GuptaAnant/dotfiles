* What are dotfiles
Dotfiles are usully those files that usually begin with a period(.). The usually are hidden files. They are usually in Unix based system and they usually is used to customize our desktop. They are put because of my convience. Anyone is free to access my dotfiles.

* How you can use them
Actually I have put an install script namely "install.sh". It is also put for my convience as if I want to do a serious distrohopp (I don't do these days). It is very easy to run. First make it executable by...

#+begin_src
chmod +x install.sh
#+end_src

Then run this by...

#+begin_src
./install.sh
#+end_src

NOTE: This will only work on Arch & Arch based system. If you want to need to work for Debian/Ubuntu distribution or any other you need to open the 'install.sh' file & replace 'yay' with your package manager helper. Also various packages are called differently on various other distribution (for instances alacritty). But this would work just fine on Arch based system.
